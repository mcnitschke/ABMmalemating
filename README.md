# ABMmalemating
Code for ABM model for evolution of male mating strategies in the human lineage.  All code related to the manuscript entitled "The male-biased sex ratio in humans and its role in the transition from promiscuity to pair bonding".
All code provided in in Matlab.

We constructed an Agent-Based model of male mating strategies, given various parameters that affect the viablility of each.  The strategy that succeeds is the strategy that produces the most offspring.
